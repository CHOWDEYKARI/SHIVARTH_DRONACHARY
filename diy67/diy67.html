interfaces with its declarative components feature.
Create Custom Components: JSX allows creating unique components 
to suit your requirements and renders sub-components with ease.
Boosts Productivity: It enables developers to redistribute the same

Quick Rendering: With virtual DOM, any change made in the app can 
be tested to check the risk level before finalizing it. Level before finalizing 
it.
SEO-Friendly: It is having fast load time and rendering which plays 
important for higher ranking in SERP.
Useful Developer Toolset: Companies like Facebook have included 
several developer tools for React framework to help developers 
immensely in discovering parent and child components, observing their 
hierarchies, and analyze their present state, etc.
Code Stability: The data flow in React certifies that the parent structure 
is not impacted by any kind of changes made in the child structure. 
Community Support: React developers are actively uploading 
text/video tutorials online and answer queries on various forums and QA 
sites

Adequate Documentation: Despite having the largest community of 
reacting developers, there is a need for proper documentation.
Develop UI Only: It is not possible to develop the complete application 
by using React.JS only.

JSX templates if you know the HTML.
• It is type-safe as most of the errors can be caught during compilation.
• It uses the render function to return a single HTML element at a time.
• React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not 
have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript).

        4. Why do we use React.js?
        • Develop components for high-performing and high-volume 
        applications.
        • Create SEO-friendly applications.
        • User-friendly and responsive single-page and quick-loading 
        applications.
        • Components can be reused and created as per requirements.
