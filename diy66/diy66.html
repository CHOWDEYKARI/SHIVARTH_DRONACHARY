        1. What is MVC architecture?
        Model – View - Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern commonly
        used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three
        interconnected parts - Model, View, and Controller.
        Model:
        It represents application data. It retrieves, stores, and maintains the data
        of the application in a database.
        View:
        A view is what you see when you visit a site. Example: blog post, contact
        form, etc. It sends the data to the client. Generally, views are HTML
        documents.
        Controller:
        It is a software code that controls the interactions between the Model
        and View.
        React is positioned in the view(V) section of the MVC model.
