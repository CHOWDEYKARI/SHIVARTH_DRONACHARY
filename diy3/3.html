            <p>A donut, also spelled doughnut, is a type of fried or baked pastry that is typically ring-shaped with a
                hole
                in the center. It is made from a sweet, enriched dough that is often flavored with ingredients such as
                sugar, vanilla, or cinnamon.

                <u> Ingredients:</u>
            <p>
                The basic ingredients for making donuts include flour, sugar, yeast, milk or water, eggs, butter or
                vegetable oil, and a pinch of salt. Additional ingredients can be used to flavor the dough or add
                toppings,
                such as chocolate, glazes, sprinkles, or fillings.
            </p>

            <u>Preparation:</u>
            <p>
                <li> To make donuts, the dough is typically mixed together, kneaded, and left to rise for a period of
                    time
                    to
                    allow the yeast to activate and the dough to become light and fluffy. After the dough has risen, it
                    is
                    rolled out and cut into ring shapes. The donuts are then either fried in hot oil until golden brown
                    or
                    baked
                    in an oven until they are cooked through.
                </li>
            </p>
