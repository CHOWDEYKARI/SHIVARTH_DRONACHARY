                suggestions like the auto-fill feature. As the user starts typing, he can see a list of
                predefined options. When the user enters more characters, the list of options
                will get filtered more. However, a user can also enter the data on their own. The
                main difference between datalist> and select> tags is that the
                datalist> tag provides the list of predefined options to select and at the same
                time allows the user to enter data on their own, whereas the select> tag
                allows users strictly to select an option out of given options and does not allow
                the entry of other data.
