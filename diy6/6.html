    <h1>Interview Questions</h1>
    <h3>1. How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?</h3>
    <p>
        In HTML, anchor tags can be used to insert hyperlinks or bookmarks. <br> Hyperlinks
        are links that can redirect the user from one webpage to another, while
        bookmarks are used to redirect the users to a specific part of the current
        webpage. <br> Anchor tags are defined using tags, where the opening tag indicates
        the beginning of the hyperlink, and the closing tag indicates the end of the
        hyperlink. <br> Anchor tags by default will appear in any of the following three ways: <br>
        Unvisited link - Underlined in blue. <br>
        Visited link - Underlined in purple. <br>
        Active link - Underlined in red. <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Q2. How are HTML elements different from HTML tags?</h3>
    <p>
        HTML elements are a collection of HTML tags, their attributes, and data that will
        be rendered on the browser, while HTML tags are used to hold the data and how
        it will be rendered on the browser. In simpler terms, HTML tags are a subset of
        HTML elements: <br>
        For example, consider the following HTML code:
    <h1> Welcome to Edureka</h1>
    Where,
    <h1> Welcome to Edureka </h1> - This complete line of code
    is an HTML element.
    <h1> and </h1> -Therefore These are the HTML tags.

    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>Q3. Does a hyperlink only apply to text?
    </h3>
    <p>
        No, a hyperlink can be applied to different types of content, including images,
        videos, and more.
        Code example
    <div>
        <p>Click the link below</p>
        <div>
            <a href=“https://edureka.co”>
                <img src=“logo.png” width=“100” />
            </a>
        </div>
    </div>
    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>Q4. How to add a picture as the background for a Web page?</h3>
    <p>
        This can be achieved by different methods. One of the methods is to use the
        “background” attribute along with the “body” tag.
        Example:

        <body background=“bgimg.jpeg”>
    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>Q5. Mention the newly added form element types in HTML5.</h3>
    <p>
        There are five new form elements in HTML5. They are:
        • Datalist: It is used to pre-define options for input. <select> is the alternate
            tag used to pre-define options, but its use ensures that the user must choose
            one of the pre-defined options. The datalist tag, instead, suggests that the
            user chooses from one of the pre-defined options. <br>
            • Output: It is used to define the result of a calculation. <br>
            • Keygen: Generates an encryption key that is used to reference data after
            form submission. (NOTE: This feature is obsolete. It is not recommended to
            use this, even though this is still supported in some browsers.) <br>
            • Progress: It is used to create a progress bar on a webpage. <br>
            • Meter: It is similar to the progress property but creates a gauge within a
            defined range. <br>
    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>Q6. What happens when an HTML document does not contain the
        “
        <!DOCTYPE html>” tag?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The primary purpose of DOCTYPE (or Document Type Declaration) is to inform
        the browser about the version and type of HTML used.
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        specifies that HTML5 is being used, otherwise the browser will not be able to
        identify it as an HTML document and the HTML5 tags might not function
        properly
    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>
        Q7. What is the purpose of the HTML entities?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Some characters are reserved in HTML, like ‘<‘,’>’, ‘&’, ‘/’, etc. To use these characters, we
            need to use HTML entities. <br>
            < &lt; &#60;> &gt; &#62;
                © &copy; &#169;
                & &amp; &#38;
                A Non-Breaking Blank Space &nbsp; &#160;
    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>Q8. What is the purpose of “required” the attribute in HTML5?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The required attribute is initialized inside the input tag to make an input field
        mandatory. When the required attribute is initialized, the form cannot be
        submitted until the mandatory fields are filled. The required attribute is a
        boolean attribute that can be used with different input types such as text, URL,
        email, password, checkbox, radio, etc.
        Code example
        <input type=“password” id=“pwd” name=“password” required />

    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>Q9. How can you use an anchor tag to open a URL in a new tab
        when clicked?</h3>
    <p>
        To open a link in a new tab on click, you can add the “target” attribute to the
        anchor tag and define its value to “_blank”. <br>
        Example:
        <a href=“#” target=“_blank”>Open this page in new tab</a>

    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>Q10. What are inline, block, and inline-block level elements in
        HTML?</h3>
    <p>
        Block Level Elements <br>
        • The elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available.<br>
        • We can set the height and width values.<br>
        • It does not allow other elements to sit next to it.
        Inline Elements <br>
        • The elements do not start on a new line and occupy only the required width.<br>
        • They cannot have a height and width set.<br>
        • Other elements sit next to them.<br>
        Inline-Block Elements<br>
        • The elements do not start on a new line and occupy only the required width.<br>
        • We can set the height and width values.<br>
        • Other elements are allowed to sit next to it.<br>

    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>Q11. Is it possible to change inline elements into block-level
        elements?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, this can be done by defining the value of the display attribute to the “block”
value in its CSS. This will change the inline-level elements to block-level elements
where the elements take the full width of the container.
For example,
display: block;
        </p>
        <!--  -->
        <h3>Q12. What is the need for Meta tags in HTML?</h3>
        <p>
            Meta tags are used to describe metadata (information) of the webpage to
browsers, search engines, and other web services. This information is not
rendered in the webpage, but it will be used by web crawlers and search engines
to rank the website for the search result page. They are always defined inside the
<head> … </head> tags and are typically used to specify the character set,
keywords, viewport settings, author, and description of the webpage.
Examples of some commonly used meta tags:
<meta charset=“UTF-8”> <br>
<meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initialscale = 1.0”> <br>
<meta name=“description” content=“HTML interview questions”> <br>
<meta name=“author” content=“Author Name”> <br>
<meta name=“copyright” content=“All Rights Reserved”><br>
