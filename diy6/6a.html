    <h3>Q1. Explain the different types of list elements in HTML.</h3>
    <p>

        Lists are used to represent data and information where each record is displayed
        in a separate line. The most used list types are:
        Unordered List (
    <ul>): Used to define an unordered list, i.e., a bulleted list of
        items.
        Ordered List (<ol>): Used to define an ordered list, i.e., numbered list of items.
            Description List (<dl>): Used to define a description list, i.e., items are arranged
                in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary.
                Code example
                <h4>Unordered List<h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tea</li>
                            <li>Coffee</li>
                            <li>Juice</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Ordered List<h4>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Tea</li>
                                    <li>Coffee</li>
                                    <li>Juice</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h4>Description List<h4>
                                        <dl>
                                            <dt>Tea</dt>
                                            <dd>Hot and Serves 2</dd>
                                            <dt>Coffee</dt>
                                            <dd> Hot and Serves 2</dd>
                                        </dl>

                                        <h3>Q2. What is the difference between the <div> tag and the <span> tag
                                                    in HTML?</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Div (
                                        <div>) tag
                                            It defines a section at the block level.
                                            Div takes up the entire width of the screen.
                                            It applies styling to other HTML tags present inside it.
                                            Span (<span>) tag
                                                It defines a section at the inline level.
                                                Span keeps to the width of the element it contains.
                                                It does not apply styling to other HTML tags present inside it.
                                                </p>

                                                <h3>Q3. What happens when you define tags without text between
                                                    them?</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    If there is no text between the HTML tags, then no formatting will
                                                    appear on the page since
                                                    there is nothing to format.
                                                    Note: Remember there are some tags like <img> tag, that do not
                                                    require a closing tag or text
                                                    between them to render.

                        <h3>Q4. What is the difference between input type=“text” />
                                                    and textarea>?</h3>
            <p>
                input type=“text”/> is used to take a single line input from the user.
                Whereas a textarea> tag is used to take multi-line input from the user.
                The input tag is a self-closing tag, while the textarea tag is a non-self-closing tag.
