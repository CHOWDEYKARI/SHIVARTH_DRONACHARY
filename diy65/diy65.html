3. Explain the difference between Single-page application 
(SPA) and Multi-Page application (MPA)?
 Single Page Application:
• A single-page application is an application that works inside a browser 
and does not require page reloading during use.
• Instead of serving a brand-new page to the user, SPA swaps out the old 
content for new in case of any user interaction.
• SPA is faster, more responsive, compact, easy to develop and deploy.
• SPA and all its content is only loaded once when the user first interacts 
with the web page.
 Multi-Page Application:
• You can combine user-defined data type to one or more existing data 
type.
• In a Multi-Page application, each time you click on a link or interact 
with the application, a new page is downloaded from the server and 
then rendered in the web browser.
• Here content is organized on individual pages that are usually static.
• They do not change in response to the user's action.
• A brand-new page with its own static content is served when a user 
clicks any button
