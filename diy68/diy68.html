        1. What is Virtual DOM?
• The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where a "virtual" 
representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" 
DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
• In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding "virtual DOM 
object".
• A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a 
lightweight copy.
• A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, 
but it lacks the power to directly change what's on the screen.
• Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster because nothing gets 
drawn onscreen.
• React defines a Virtual DOM as a glue between your Program and the 
Browser DOM.
• Virtual DOM makes optimum updates to the Actual DOM utilizing a 
quick differential
• Virtual DOM provides supreme performance.

        2. What is NPM?
• NPM is the world's largest Software Registry with 10 lakh code 
packages. Developers use NPM to share software. Many organizations 
also use NPM to manage private development.
• NPM is free to use; you can download all NPM public software 
packages without any registration or login.
• All NPM packages are defined in a file called package.json. At least 
two fields must be present in the definition file: name and version.
• NPM is installed with Node.js. This means you have to install Node.js 
to get NPM installed in your system. Refer LMS to install Node.js.

        3. What is package.json?
        A package.json in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module, 
        where modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project. 
        package.json is used to store the metadata associated with the project as 
        well as to store the list of dependency packages. The metadata can be 
        categorized into two:
        1. Identifying metadata:
        It consists of the properties to identify the project such as the 
        name, current version of the module, license, author of the 
        project, description of the project, and more.
        2. Functional metadata:
        It consist of the functional properties of the project such as the 
        entry point of the module, dependencies in project, scripts being 
        used, repository links of project, and more.
