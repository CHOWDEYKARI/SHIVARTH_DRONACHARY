        What is Node JS?
        <p>
            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to build and execute
            server-side applications using JavaScript. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has since gained
            widespread popularity in the web development community.

            Traditionally, JavaScript was mainly used for client-side scripting within web browsers to enhance the
            interactivity of web pages. However, Node.js extends the capabilities of JavaScript by allowing it to be
            used on the server side as well. This means developers can write both the client-side and server-side code
            using the same programming language, simplifying the development process and making it easier to share code
            between different parts of a web application.

            Key features of Node.js include:

            1. **Non-blocking I/O:** Node.js is built on an asynchronous, event-driven architecture. This means that
            instead of waiting for a task to complete before moving on to the next one, Node.js can handle multiple
            tasks concurrently, making it well-suited for applications that require handling a large number of
            concurrent connections, such as real-time applications.

            2. **Fast Execution:** Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used in Google Chrome.
            This engine compiles JavaScript code to machine code, resulting in fast execution speeds.

            3. **NPM (Node Package Manager):** NPM is a package manager that comes bundled with Node.js. It allows
            developers to easily install, manage, and share third-party libraries and modules, making it easier to
            integrate existing solutions into their projects.

            4. **Server-side Development:** Node.js is commonly used to build web servers, APIs (Application Programming
            Interfaces), and other server-side applications. It provides a rich set of libraries and tools to handle
            network communication, file system operations, and more.

            5. **Scalability:** Due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, Node.js is well-suited for building
            highly scalable applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections without consuming
            excessive resources.

            6. **Community and Ecosystem:** Node.js has a vibrant and active community that contributes to the
            development of numerous third-party libraries and frameworks. This ecosystem enables developers to quickly
            build complex applications by leveraging existing tools and resources.

            7. **Cross-platform:** Node.js is designed to be cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating
            systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

            Node.js is commonly used for web application development, APIs, real-time applications (like chat
            applications and online gaming), streaming servers, and more. It has significantly impacted the way web
            applications are developed by enabling the use of a single programming language throughout the entire
            application stack, making development more efficient and consistent.

    <h3>What is NPM?

        <p>NPM stands for "Node Package Manager." It is a package manager for JavaScript that comes bundled with
            Node.js. NPM allows developers to easily manage and distribute JavaScript libraries, modules, and packages,
            making it an essential tool for building and maintaining Node.js applications.

            Here are some key features and functions of NPM:

            1. **Package Management:** NPM provides a command-line interface that allows developers to search for,
            install, update, and uninstall packages from the NPM registry. Packages are collections of code that can be
            reused in projects, which can save developers a significant amount of time and effort.

            2. **Dependency Management:** When building applications, developers often rely on external libraries and
            modules. NPM helps manage these dependencies by keeping track of which packages a project requires. It
            maintains a file called `package.json` that lists all the dependencies along with their version numbers.
            This makes it easier to ensure consistent and reproducible builds across different environments.

            3. **Version Control:** NPM allows developers to specify version ranges for packages in the `package.json`
            file. This enables fine-grained control over which versions of packages are used in a project, helping to
            prevent compatibility issues.

            4. **Global and Local Packages:** NPM supports the installation of packages globally, making them available
            across multiple projects, as well as locally within a specific project. This flexibility allows developers
            to manage both project-specific dependencies and tools that can be used globally.

            5. **Scripts:** NPM enables developers to define custom scripts in the `package.json` file. These scripts
            can be executed using the `npm run` command. This feature is often used to automate common tasks like
            running tests, building the application, or starting a development server.

            6. **Registry:** NPM hosts a central repository called the NPM registry, which contains a vast collection of
            open-source JavaScript packages. Developers can publish their packages to the registry, making them
            available for others to use.

            7. **Private Packages:** In addition to public packages available in the NPM registry, developers can also
            publish private packages that are only accessible to authorized users. This is useful for organizations that
            want to share code internally without making it publicly available.

            Overall, NPM simplifies the process of managing external dependencies and sharing code in the JavaScript
            ecosystem. It has played a crucial role in the popularity and growth of Node.js by providing a convenient
            way for developers to access and distribute reusable code components.</p>
